## [Unreleased]

## [0.3.10] — 2026-05-11

### Security
- **All GitHub Actions are now SHA-pinned.** Every `uses:` directive across the 6 workflow files references a commit SHA (`actions/checkout@34e114876…`) with a `# vX.Y.Z` comment for human readability. Floating major tags (`@v4`) reflect whatever upstream pushes to that ref; an upstream account compromise would land on every CI run on the next refresh — the same class of attack as the tj-actions/changed-files 2025 incident. Pinning to SHAs freezes that surface; Dependabot moves it forward under review.
- **`.github/dependabot.yml` added** for the `github-actions` ecosystem. Weekly grouped PRs, batched so a single security gate covers the batch. Each PR hits the full required-checks matrix (validate, guardskills, codeql, dependency-review, release-guards) before merge.
- **Branch-protection drift detection.** New workflow `.github/workflows/branch-protection-drift.yml` runs daily and on changes to its snapshot; asserts that `refs/heads/main` live protection matches the checked-in expected state at `.github/branch-protection.expected.json`. Closes the audit gap where protection settings (which live in GitHub Settings, not in the repo) could silently drift from documented intent. Uses `permissions: administration: read` on the default `GITHUB_TOKEN` — no PAT, no long-lived secret.

### Changed
- `.github/workflows/npm-publish.yml` — runner upgraded from Node 22 (npm 10.9) to Node 24 (npm 11.x) in the prior unreleased period. Captured here for completeness.
- `SECURITY.md` — AST08 row updated to reflect OIDC Trusted Publisher + SHA-pinning. AST09 row updated to reference the new branch-protection drift control.

### Removed
- `NPM_TOKEN` repo secret. No publish secret remains; nothing to rotate, nothing to leak.

## [0.3.9] — 2026-05-11

### Security
- **npm publish auth migrated to OIDC Trusted Publisher.** `npm-publish.yml` no longer references `NPM_TOKEN` / `NODE_AUTH_TOKEN`; the GitHub Actions OIDC token authenticates the publish against the Trusted Publisher binding configured on npmjs.com (Repository: `t4sh/skills4sh`, Workflow: `npm-publish.yml`). The same token signs the provenance attestation. **There is no long-lived publish secret to rotate or leak.** Previous token-based flow (v0.3.0 — v0.3.8) is superseded.

### Fixed
- **`validate.yml` shallow clone bypassed the v0.3.8 semver monotonicity check.** `actions/checkout@v4` defaults to `fetch-depth: 1`, which hides `HEAD^` from `bin/drift-check.mjs`'s `git show` call — the check was silently skipping in CI on push events. Set `fetch-depth: 2` so the previous-commit comparison runs in CI as designed.

## [0.3.8] — 2026-05-11

### Added
- `CONTRIBUTING.md` documenting the skill-authoring workflow (frontmatter contract, seven-place version-sync surface, `.security/<name>.yaml` manifest schema, hook setup, PR expectations).
- `CHANGELOG.md` (this file) — reconstructed from git history; reflects per-tag release notes.
- `bin/install.mjs`: explicit stderr deprecation warning when `--force` is passed; flag remains a no-op (re-runs are idempotent by content hash). To be removed in v1.0.
- `bin/guardskills-check.mjs`: default-deny severity floor — HIGH and CRITICAL findings require an explicit `acknowledged: true` field on the corresponding `.security/<name>.yaml` `expected_findings` entry. Closes a third-party audit gap where a real HIGH finding could be silenced by pre-declaration.
- `bin/drift-check.mjs`: semver monotonicity check — SKILL.md `metadata.version` may not decrease between commits. Compares against `HEAD^` via `git show`; skips gracefully when previous version is not available (initial commit, shallow clone).
- `README.md`: stability note flagging `eleventy-nunjucks` as pre-1.0.

### Changed
- `.security/eleventy-nunjucks.yaml`: 6 HIGH-severity `expected_findings` entries now carry `acknowledged: true` (no behavior change; explicit acknowledgement per new severity-floor policy).
- `.security/localhost-screenshots.yaml`: 2 HIGH-severity `expected_findings` entries now carry `acknowledged: true`.
- `package.json#files` now includes `CHANGELOG.md`.

## [0.3.7] — 2026-05-11

### Security
- `localhost-screenshots` 3.3.0 — cleared Agent Trust Hub HIGH findings:
  - Removed `sudo npx playwright install-deps`; replaced `node -e "…"` existence check with `test -d node_modules/playwright`.
  - Added an `Untrusted Content Boundary` section to SKILL.md; bundled `assets/scripts/screenshot-a11y.js` enforces `{ boundary: 'untrusted-page-content', source, … }` envelope on accessibility-tree, DOM, and interactive-map captures.
  - Documented `npm ci` + lockfile pinning; gated `ignoreHTTPSErrors` to localhost-only hostnames.

## [0.3.6] — 2026-05-11

### Fixed
- CI: restored validate workflow and made the guardskills PR matrix always-on.
- CI: dropped pull-request path filters on validate + release-guards so guards always run, regardless of which paths a PR touches.
- First release commit verified by GitHub as signed.

## [0.3.5] — 2026-05-11

### Changed
- CI: avoid misleading completeness success output in `release.yml`.
- Hardened the v0.3.5 publish gates and tightened pre-publish guards.

### Added
- `tests/integration.test.mjs` — fixture-backed installer integration coverage (rate limit, hash mismatch, atomic install preservation, dry-run, real `npm pack` + install).

### Docs
- README: clarified install paths and security posture.

## [0.3.4] — 2026-05-11

### Changed
- Trimmed the published tarball (`package.json#files`) to only what consumers need.
- Made `.githooks` wiring opt-in via `bin/setup-hooks.sh` — the `prepare` script no longer mutates downstream consumers' `.git/config`.

## [0.3.3] — 2026-05-11

### Changed
- CI: migrated `npm-publish.yml` to OIDC Trusted Publisher; fixed `verify-published.mjs` step.

### Docs
- Documented the OIDC publish posture in SECURITY.md.

### Note
- First version published via OIDC Trusted Publisher.

## [0.3.2] — 2026-05-11

### Fixed
- Silent-bin bug when invoked via the npm-installed symlink at `node_modules/.bin/skills4sh`. The CLI guard now resolves the symlink with `realpathSync` before comparing against `import.meta.url`; otherwise the entry-point check fails and the CLI prints nothing.

## [0.3.1] — 2026-05-11

### Security
- Supply-chain hardening (no API changes):
  - Switched `package-lock.json` → `npm-shrinkwrap.json` so transitive dependencies (undici) ship locked.
  - Added `npm-publish.yml` with OIDC provenance + SLSA v1 attestation.
  - Pinned `guardskills@1.2.1`; allowlisted documented false positives.
  - Aligned and hardened SECURITY.md (AST10 mapping).
  - Added pre-commit `hash-check.mjs` hook in `.githooks/pre-commit`.
  - Added `release.yml` to replicate the `prepublishOnly` check in CI on tag push.

### Added
- 46 installer unit tests (`tests/installer.test.mjs`); main-guard refactor on `bin/install.mjs` so tests can import pure functions without running the CLI.

### Docs
- README: aligned install-path claim with `bin/install.mjs` `DEFAULT_DEST` (`~/.claude/skills`).

## [0.3.0] — 2026-05-11

### Added
- `eleventy-nunjucks` skill (initial v0.1.0).
- `bin/tag-parity` guard (`.github/scripts/check-bin-tag-parity.sh`) — refuses to publish if `bin/` diverges from the tag for the version in `package.json`. Motivated by an actual v0.2.0 incident where the tarball's `bin/` did not match its tag.

## [0.2.0] — 2026-04-19

### Added
- CI: enforce version parity between `package.json`, `.claude-plugin/marketplace.json`, and `.cursor-plugin/plugin.json` via `verify-versions.sh`.

## [0.1.1] — 2026-04-19

### Added
- Initial public release of the `skills4sh` package.
